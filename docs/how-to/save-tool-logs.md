## How to save the tool logs

The `--tool-logs-basepath` option specifies the base directory path where Calrissian will save the logs generated by each CWL (Common Workflow Language) tool during the execution of a workflow. 

These logs capture detailed information about the execution of each tool, which can be critical for debugging, monitoring, and auditing purposes.

During the execution of a CWL workflow, each tool that is run as part of the workflow may produce logs. These logs include standard output, standard error, and any other tool-specific logging information.

The `--tool-logs-basepath` option allows you to define a base directory where all these logs will be stored. 

Calrissian organizes the logs within this directory, typically creating subdirectories for each tool or task. By setting this path, you ensure that all tool logs are centrally located and easily accessible for post-execution review.

    spec:
      serviceAccountName: calrissian-sa
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 1000
      containers:
        - name: calrissian
          image: ghcr.io/duke-gcb/calrissian/calrissian:0.16.0
          command: ["calrissian"]
          args:
            - --tool-logs-basepath 
            - /calrissian/logs
            ...
            - /app-package/app-package.cwl
            - /inputs/params.yaml
          volumeMounts:
            - name: calrissian-volume

      restartPolicy: Never
      volumes:
        - name: calrissian-volume
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: calrissian-claim 
        - name: params-volume
          configMap:
